# SVG Logo maker


## Description
In this project, I built a command-line application using Node.js that allows users to generate a simple logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then creates an SVG file based on the user's input. Throughout the development of this project, I gained several key learnings. First, I deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming principles by implementing classes for different shapes and leveraging inheritance to share common functionality. This allowed for cleaner and more organized code structure. I learned how to control the positioning and appearance of shapes and text within an SVG using attributes like viewBox and text-anchor. This knowledge can be extended to other SVG-based projects in the future. I also became familiar with command-line input handling using Inquirer, enabling a user-friendly interface for gathering input from the user. This experience will be valuable for building future command-line applications that require user interaction. Overall, this project provided me with practical experience in OOP, SVG manipulation, and command-line application development, enhancing my skill for the future.
